# Multiple Change Point Detection with Conceptors
Repository includes:
- Code used to obtain simulated data (.R files) can be generated by running "filewrite.R" along with the corresponding utility files in the main directory. Data files are located at the Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/141bvh19ILs3eOnWlIvVAvB3IJsoaZPUc?usp=share_link).

- Simulation code used to generate results and figures discussed in paper (.R, .cpp, and .m files). 

- Simulation results can be found at the same Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/141bvh19ILs3eOnWlIvVAvB3IJsoaZPUc?usp=share_link).
