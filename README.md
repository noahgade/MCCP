# Multiple Change Point Detection with Conceptors
Repository includes:
- Code used to obtain simulated data (.R files) can be generated by running "file_write.R" along with the corresponding utility files in the main directory. Data files are located at the Google Drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/141bvh19ILs3eOnWlIvVAvB3IJsoaZPUc?usp=share_link).

- Simulation code used to generate results and figures discussed in paper (.R, .cpp, and .m files). 

- Simulation results can be found at the same Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/141bvh19ILs3eOnWlIvVAvB3IJsoaZPUc?usp=share_link).

- Matlab code taken and adapted from "Online Kernel CUSUM for Change-Point Detection" [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15070.pdf) [GitHub](https://github.com/SongWei-GT/online_kernel_cusum) (Wei and Xie 2023).
